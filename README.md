# Fibaro-Dimmer-211
SmartThings Device type for Fibaro Dimmer 211
I have final cobbled together a device type handler for the Fibaro Dimmer 211 which includes the ability to change the parameters. I have struggled trying to change parameters on this unit and could not find any code that actually worked. So I set about creating something that would.
It's not the most elegant solution but it works (for me anyway) and once you have the parameters set  up exactly as you want them you can revert back to your previous DTH if you prefer as the 211 unit should retain it's settings.

Log in to the Developers website and click My Device Handlers. 
Click +New Device Handler then select From Code.
Copy the Device type code and paste it into your New Device Handler then click Create.

To change a parameter value you need to change it in the code. Scroll down the code to the INSTRUCTIONS section and you should be able to read what to do.
As I can now change parameters I feel I have finally tamed this unit
Hope it works for you.
